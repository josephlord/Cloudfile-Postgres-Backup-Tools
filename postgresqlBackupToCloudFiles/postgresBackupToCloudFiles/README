To run a backup copy the configTemplate.py file to myConfig.py and configure
for your database and Cloud Files account then run backupScript.py

Test it first with your configuration before scheduling it and make sure to
check that the files appear on your CloudFiles account.

If you set CLOUDFILEDESTINATIONADDMONTHANDYEAR the container name used will be:
YYYY-MM-[CLOUDFILEDESTINATIONCONTAINER].

If there is a database password you must have the .pgpass file (or on Windows 
the %APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf) file configured in your home directory
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/libpq-pgpass.html.  I believe that
this is a limitation of the pg_dump application that it cannot accept passwords
on the commandline.  If the script is scheduled you will need to make sure it is
run as the appropriate user.

Future development that I may add would be to add additional cleanup scripts
and possibly a restore from the latest backup.  Additional features could also
include email notification of the result and additional robustness/error
handling which is currently very limited and simple.  I'll only add features
when there is a real need for them though if you want to contribute I'd be more
than happy to accept these or potentially other features.
